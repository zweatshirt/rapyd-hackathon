 Circuit 1

 ## Potential ideas for project design:
- We know we want to do a web application
- I (Zach) recommend using React for the front end, and Django or Firebase for the backend, but am 100% open for suggestions.
- We have to integrate two or more Rapyd platforms
For now, we should all be considering what Rapyd platforms to integrate, getting used to Git's workflow etc.
We can discuss more together.
