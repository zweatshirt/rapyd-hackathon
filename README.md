 Circuit 1
 
## Inspiration
We wanted a platform like Facebook marketplace, but didn't enjoy the fact that you have to meet people in person in order to fulfill trades or to sell personal items.
## What it does
- Our application allows people to trade items easily. Each person has their own list of items, and an explanation of what they want in return for the item(s) they are selling.
- In a trade, people can offer their own items including money to fully close a trade with someone. For example, if you're trading an item you value at $700, someone else can offer you an item valued at $500, and give you $200 in cash, if this satisfies your requirement. 
## How we built it
- Our team learned the MERN stack from the ground up.
## Challenges we ran into
- Nearly everything. None of us had experience with Express, React, Redux, etc.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Creating a fully secure and responsive sign in/signup experience.
## What we learned
- MongoDB
- Express.js/Node.js
- Authentication
- User creation
- React.js
## What's next for Gryzzly
- We all hail from the same school, and there's a chance this project will continue to be built and modified.
